title: Trusted Programming @ Huawei
layout: default
---

As a leading telecommunications company on a global scale, [Huawei is dedicated
to trusted programming][mission]. To achieve this goal, our team of developers relies heavily on the 
support provided by [Rust programming language][rust]. As a founding member of 
[the Rust Foundation][foundation], Huawei is fully committed to the growth and prosperity of the 
Rust community and sponsoring Rust Conferences, including [RustConf][rustconf], 
[Rust Nation UK][rustnation], [EuroRust][eurorust], [GoSim][gosim] and Rust China Conference.

To demonstrate our commitment, we create development tools and [deep code learning technology][dcl] 
to help software engineering with Rust, and are continuously contributing to the improvement and
expansion of Rust's features, including those listed in the roadmaps on [language][lang_roadmap],
[compiler][compiler_roadmap] and [library][library_roadmap] teams.
