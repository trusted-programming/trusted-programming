The `format_args!()` macro and underlying `std::fmt::Argument` type form the basis of all printing and formatting machinery in the Rust standard library,
such as `println!()`, `format!()`, and `write!()`.

By improving the macro and the in-memory representation of the `fmt::Arguments` type, a significant reduction in binary size can be achieved. This is especially
important for embedded software running on devices with limited storage and memory.
