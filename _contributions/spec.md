Huawei supports the efforts of the Rust project and Rust Foundation towards a
complete and accurate official Rust language specification.

The Rust language specification will have a big impact on the ability to write
safety critical software in Rust, will improve the internal consistency of the language,
and be an important tool to greatly improve the precision and completeness of existing and future language proposals.
